## 1. Template literals
- Modern and flexible way to work with strings
- Template literals are strings enclosed by backticks (\` \`) instead of quotes. 

### Syntax
```js
`string text ${expression} string text`
```
### a) String Interpolation
Inserting variables or expresssion into strings

### Example
```js
let name = "Mahes";
let age = 21;

console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);
// Output: My name is Mahes and I am 21 years old.
```

### b) Multi-line Strings
Without the need for escape character
```js
let message = `This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3`;

console.log(message);
```

### Output
```js
This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
```

### c) Embed Expressions
Embedding expression directly in strings
```js
let a = 5;
let b = 10;

console.log(`The sum is ${a + b}`); // Output: The sum is 15
```
