## 2. Promises

- Promises were introduced in ES6 to solve problems like callback hell.

- A Promise represents a **satus of the asynchronous operation.**

## States of a Promise
1. Pending – Initial state, the operation is still in progress.

2. Fulfilled – The operation completed successfully (resolve is called).

3. Rejected – The operation failed (reject is called).

```js
const promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // Simulate async task
  let success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve('✅ Task completed successfully');
  } else {
    reject('❌ Task failed');
  }
});

// Consuming the promise
promise
  .then(result => console.log(result))    // if resolved
  .catch(error => console.log(error));    // if rejected
```

A Promise is an object that connects:

1. Producing code – the code that performs a time-consuming task.

2. Consuming code – the code that uses the result of the producing code.


## Promise object Properties
It supports two properties state and result
myPromise.state - pending, fulfilled, rejected
myPromise.result - undefined, result values, error object

Promise.then() takes two arguments, callback for success and failure

Handline Promises Method
then() - for handling resolved value
catch() - for handling rejected value
finally() - executes regardless of the promise outcome
