## 4. What is the Event Loop?
- JavaScript can only do one thing at a time (it's single-threaded).

- The event loop allows JavaScript to handle tasks like waiting for data or timers without freezing the page.

## Key Parts:
## 1. Call Stack:

- It runs regular (synchronous) code, like printing something to the screen.

- It runs **one task at a time**, in the order they appear.

## 2. Web APIs:

- These **handle things that take time**, like waiting for data from a server or a timer (setTimeout()).

- Once these are done, they send the result to the callback queue.

## 3. Callback Queue:

- When Web APIs finish their tasks, they send the results to the callback queue.

- The event loop checks if the call stack is empty, and if it is, it runs the tasks from the callback queue.

## How It Works:
- First, regular code runs.

- Then, tasks that take time (like timers or fetching data) are handled by Web APIs.

- Once those tasks are done, their results go to the callback queue.

- The event loop makes sure regular code is done before running the tasks in the callback queue.

- In simple terms: The event loop helps JavaScript do many things without getting stuck or freezing the page!
